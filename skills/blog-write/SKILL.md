# Blog Writer: New Article Generation

Writes complete blog articles from a topic, brief, or outline. Every article
follows the 6 pillars of dual optimization (Google rankings + AI citations).

**Key references** (paths relative to repo root; references live in the
main `blog` skill's references directory, not in `blog-write/`):

- `skills/blog/references/synthesis-contract.md`: 6 LAWs for synthesis output (v1.8.0; applies whenever the article embeds research-synthesis prose)
- `skills/blog/references/content-templates.md`: Template selection guide and usage
- `skills/blog/references/quality-scoring.md`: 5-category scoring (Content 30, SEO 25, E-E-A-T 15, Technical 15, AI Citation 15)
- `skills/blog/references/eeat-signals.md`: Experience, expertise, authority, trust markers
- `skills/blog/references/internal-linking.md`: Linking strategy and anchor text rules
- `skills/blog/references/visual-media.md`: Image sourcing and chart styling

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Surface Targeting (do this BEFORE research)

Decide which of the FLOW 5 surfaces this post is meant to win. The choice
shapes structure, length, citation density, and call-to-action. The 5 surfaces
in 2026:

1. Owned site (organic Google ranking)
2. SERP including AI Overviews
3. AI assistant citations (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, You.com)
4. Local pack (out of scope for blog content; use claude-seo for local)
5. Communities and video (Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, Quora, niche forums)

Most posts target surfaces 1, 2, and 3 by default. If the same query also
surfaces in a community (Reddit thread, YouTube comment), apply dual-surface
thinking: optimize the post for extraction AND plan a community echo (covered
in `/blog repurpose`).

For a deeper surface-by-surface workflow, see
`skills/blog/references/flow-alignment.md` and `/blog flow find`.

### Phase 1: Topic Understanding

1. **Clarify the topic** - If the user provides just a topic, ask:
   - Target audience (who is this for?)
   - Primary keyword / search intent
   - Desired word count (default: 2,000-2,500 words)
   - Platform/format (MDX, markdown, HTML - auto-detect if in a project)
2. **If a brief exists** - Load it and skip to Phase 1.5

### Phase 1.5: Template Selection

Select the appropriate content template from the 12 templates in
`skills/blog/templates/` (the main `blog` skill owns the templates directory).

1. **Auto-detect content type** from the topic and search intent:
   | Signal | Template |
   |--------|----------|
   | "How to...", process, steps | `how-to-guide` |
   | "Best X", "Top N", list format | `listicle` |
   | Client result, before/after, metrics | `case-study` |
   | "X vs Y", comparison, alternatives | `comparison` |
   | Broad topic, comprehensive guide | `pillar-page` |
   | "Is X worth it", product evaluation | `product-review` |
   | Opinion, prediction, industry take | `thought-leadership` |
   | Expert quotes, multi-source collection | `roundup` |
   | Code walkthrough, tool demo, technical | `tutorial` |
   | Breaking news, algorithm update, event | `news-analysis` |
   | Survey results, experiment, original data | `data-research` |
   | Q&A, knowledge base, "What is X" | `faq-knowledge` |

2. **Load the matching template**: Read from `skills/blog/templates/<type>.md`
3. **Adapt the outline** - Use the template's section structure, heading patterns,
   and word count guidance to shape Phase 3's outline
4. **Fallback** - If no template clearly fits, use the generic outline structure
   in Phase 3 below. Inform the user which template was selected (or that none matched).

See `skills/blog/references/content-templates.md` for detailed selection criteria and intent mapping.

### Phase 2: Research

Spawn a `blog-researcher` agent (or do inline research with WebSearch):

1. **Find 8-12 current statistics** (2025-2026 data preferred)
   - Search: `[topic] study 2025 2026 data statistics`
   - Prioritize tier 1-3 sources (see `skills/blog/references/quality-scoring.md`)
   - Record: statistic, source name, URL, date, methodology
2. **Find a cover image** (wide, high-quality, topic-relevant):
   - Search: `site:pixabay.com [topic] wide banner` (preferred)
   - Alternative: `site:unsplash.com [topic] wide`
   - Fallback: `site:pexels.com [topic] wide banner`
   - Target dimensions: 1200x630 (OG-compatible) or 1920x1080
   - Or generate a custom SVG cover via `blog-chart` (text-on-gradient with key stat)
   - Or generate a custom AI image via `blog-image` sub-skill (if nanobanana-mcp configured)
   - See `skills/blog/references/visual-media.md` for cover image sizing details
3. **Find 3-5 inline images** from open-source platforms:
   - **Pixabay** (preferred): Search `site:pixabay.com [topic keywords]`
     - Extract image URL from page
     - Direct URLs: `https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/YYYY/MM/DD/HH/MM/filename.jpg`
     - Verify with `curl -sI "<url>" | head -1` returns HTTP 200
   - **Unsplash** (alternative): Search `site:unsplash.com [topic keywords]`
     - Build URL: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-<id>?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&q=80`
   - **Pexels** (fallback): Search `site:pexels.com [topic keywords]`
4. **Plan 2-4 data visualizations** from researched statistics
   - Select diverse chart types (see `skills/blog/references/visual-media.md`)
   - Map data points to chart formats
5. **AI image generation** (optional, if nanobanana-mcp configured):
   - If stock photo results are insufficient (< 3 good matches) or topic is too niche
   - Generate custom hero image and/or inline illustrations via `blog-image` sub-skill
   - Stock photos remain default - AI generation supplements, never replaces
6. **NotebookLM research** (optional, if user has relevant notebooks):
   - If the user mentions a NotebookLM notebook or the topic aligns with a configured notebook
   - Query via `blog-notebooklm` for source-grounded data from user-uploaded documents
   - Treat NotebookLM responses as Tier 1 sources (user's own primary documents)
   - Falls back silently if not configured or not authenticated
7. **Find relevant YouTube videos** (2-3 per post):
   - Use `blog-google` youtube command or WebSearch `site:youtube.com [topic] [year]`
   - Apply quality criteria from `skills/blog/references/video-embeds.md` (min score 50/100)
   - Select 2-3 best videos. Falls back silently if none found.

### Phase 3: Outline Generation

Create a structured outline before writing. If a template was loaded in Phase 1.5,
adapt this skeleton to match the template's section structure:

```
# [Title as Question - Include Primary Keyword]

## Introduction (100-150 words)
- Hook with surprising statistic
- Problem/opportunity statement
- What the reader will learn

> **Key Takeaways**
> - [Core finding with statistic and source]
> - [Second key insight or recommendation]
> - [Third actionable takeaway]
> (3-5 bullets, 40-60 words combined)

## H2: [Question Format] (300-400 words)
- Answer-first paragraph (40-60 words with stat + source)
- Supporting evidence
- [Image placement]
- Practical advice
- [CITATION CAPSULE placeholder]
- [INTERNAL-LINK: anchor text → target description]

## H2: [Question Format] (300-400 words)
- Answer-first paragraph
- [Chart: type + data description]
- Analysis and implications
- [CITATION CAPSULE placeholder]
- [INTERNAL-LINK: anchor text → target description]

## H2: [Statement for Variety] (300-400 words)
- Answer-first paragraph
- Real-world example or case study
- [Image placement]
- [CITATION CAPSULE placeholder]

## H2: [Question Format] (300-400 words)
- Answer-first paragraph
- [Chart: type + data description]
- Step-by-step guidance
- [CITATION CAPSULE placeholder]
- [INTERNAL-LINK: anchor text → target description]

## H2: [Question Format] (200-300 words)
- Answer-first paragraph
- Forward-looking analysis

## [CTA Section or Inline Placement]
- See `skills/blog/references/cta-placement.md` for placement rules by content type
- Place CTA after value delivery, not at arbitrary positions
- Single focused CTA per post (266% more conversions)
- [CTA: contextual call-to-action matching article topic]

## FAQ Section (3-5 questions, 40-60 words each answer)
- [INTERNAL-LINK: anchor text → detailed content]

## Conclusion (100-150 words)
- Key takeaways (bulleted)
- Call to action
- [INTERNAL-LINK: anchor text → next logical content]
```

Present the outline to the user for approval before writing.

**Visual element pacing**: Insert `[IMAGE]`, `[CHART]`, `[VIDEO]`, or `[CALLOUT]` markers
every 300-500 words. Alternate types (no consecutive same-type). See
`skills/blog/references/content-rules.md` Visual Rhythm section and
`skills/blog/references/cta-placement.md` for CTA positioning.

### Phase 4: Chart Generation (Built-In)

When the researcher identifies chart-worthy data (3+ comparable metrics, trend data,
before/after comparisons):

1. Select chart type using the diversity rule (no repeated types per post)
2. Invoke `blog-chart` sub-skill with: chart type, title, data values, source, platform format
3. Embed the returned SVG directly in the post within a `<figure>` wrapper
4. Target 2-4 charts per 2,000-word post
5. Distribute charts evenly - never cluster them

See `skills/blog/references/visual-media.md` for chart type selection and styling rules.

### Phase 5: Content Writing

Write the full article following these rules:

#### 5a. Frontmatter
```yaml
---
title: "[Question-format title with primary keyword]"
description: "[Fact-dense, 150-160 chars, includes 1 statistic]"
coverImage: "[URL from Pixabay/Unsplash/Pexels or generated SVG path]"
coverImageAlt: "[Descriptive sentence about the cover image]"
ogImage: "[Same as coverImage, or custom OG image URL]"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
lastUpdated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "[Author name]"
tags: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]
---
```

If the platform uses a different field name (e.g., `image`, `hero`, `thumbnail`),
adapt to match the project's existing frontmatter convention.

#### 5b. Summary Box (Key Takeaways)

Immediately after the introduction (before the first H2 body section), add a summary box:

```markdown
> **Key Takeaways**
> - [Core finding with statistic] ([Source], year)
> - [Second key insight or recommendation]
> - [Third actionable takeaway]
```

Requirements:
- 3-5 bullet points, 40-60 words combined
- Must be self-contained - understandable without reading the article
- Include 1 specific statistic with source name
- State the key finding, recommendation, or answer
- Default label: "Key Takeaways". If a persona is active, use the persona's summary_label
- Backward compatible: accept existing TL;DR boxes during rewrites

#### 5c. Answer-First Formatting (Critical)
Every H2 section MUST open with a 40-60 word paragraph containing:
- At least one specific statistic with source attribution
- A direct answer to the heading's implicit question

Pattern:
```markdown
## How Does X Impact Y in 2026?

[Stat from source] ([Source Name](url), year). [Direct answer to the heading
question in 1-2 more sentences, explaining the implication and what this means
for the reader.]
```

**FLOW evidence triple (drafting requirement, not just audit):**

Every public statistic must carry three components AT DRAFTING TIME:

1. **Year anchor in prose.** Write "In 2026," or "As of Q1 2026," BEFORE
   the statistic, in the sentence body. Year buried inside parentheses
   does not count. Example:
   - GOOD: "In 2026, Ahrefs found a 58% lower CTR for position one when
     an AI Overview was present."
   - WEAK: "Position-one CTR dropped 58% (Ahrefs, 2026)."

2. **Inline citation with publisher and title.** Name both the publisher
   and the document title (or report name), not just a brand. Example:
   - GOOD: "Ahrefs, AI Overviews CTR update, December 2025"
   - WEAK: "Ahrefs reported..."

3. **URL plus retrieval date in the source block at the bottom of the post.**
   Provenance discipline lets future readers and AI crawlers verify the
   source still says what was claimed. Format:
   - "[Publisher], [Title], retrieved YYYY-MM-DD, [full URL]"

**FLOW quality bar (drop or replace):**
Public claims must use verified sources OR stay qualitative. If a statistic
cannot be verified, drop it. If it is contradicted by a more recent source,
replace it with the verified alternative. Do not soften vague language to
keep an unsourceable number.

For evidence-led optimization prompts (CTR audit, AI detector test, schema,
PAA rewording, ChatGPT visibility), see `/blog flow optimize`.

#### 5d. Information Gain Markers

Distribute at least 2-3 information gain markers throughout the article. These
signal to search engines and AI systems that the content contains original value
not available elsewhere.

Tag each with a comment or visible marker:

- `[ORIGINAL DATA]` - Proprietary surveys, experiments, A/B test results, case
  study metrics the author collected first-hand
- `[PERSONAL EXPERIENCE]` - First-hand observations, lessons learned from direct
  involvement, "when we tried X, Y happened" narratives
- `[UNIQUE INSIGHT]` - Analysis others haven't made, contrarian perspectives
  backed by data, novel connections between existing research

Placement:
- Weave into the body text naturally
- Use as inline comments: `<!-- [ORIGINAL DATA] -->` before the relevant paragraph
- Or as visible callouts if the format supports it:
  ```markdown
  > **Our finding:** [original observation backed by specific data]
  ```
- Minimum 2 per post, target 3 for comprehensive articles

These markers map directly to the "Originality/unique value markers" criterion
in the Content Quality scoring category (see `skills/blog/references/quality-scoring.md`).

#### 5e. Citation Capsules

For each major H2 section, generate a citation capsule - a 40-60 word self-contained
passage designed so AI systems can extract and quote it directly.

Requirements per capsule:
- 40-60 words, self-contained (makes sense in isolation)
- Contains: one specific claim + one data point + source attribution
- Written in a declarative, quotable style
- Placed within the H2 section body (not as a separate block)

Example:
```markdown
According to a 2026 Gartner study, 58% of enterprise buyers now consult AI
assistants before contacting a vendor ([Gartner](https://www.gartner.com), 2026).
This shift means B2B content must answer specific questions concisely enough
for AI systems to extract and cite in their responses.
```

Capsules map to the "AI Citation Readiness" scoring category (15 points) in
`skills/blog/references/quality-scoring.md`.

#### 5f. Internal Linking Zones

Mark internal linking opportunities throughout the article using placeholder
notation. The user (or a follow-up pass) will resolve these to actual URLs.

Zone placement:
- **Introduction** - Link to related pillar content or topic hub
- **Each H2 section** - Link to supporting articles, deeper dives, related tools
- **FAQ section** - Link answers to detailed content that expands on the answer
- **Conclusion** - Link to the next logical piece of content the reader should consume

Format:
```markdown
[INTERNAL-LINK: anchor text → target description]
```

Example:
```markdown
For a deeper dive into keyword clustering, see our
[INTERNAL-LINK: complete guide to keyword clustering → pillar page on keyword research methodology].
```

Target 5-10 internal link zones per 2,000-word post. Use descriptive anchor text
(never "click here" or "read more"). See `skills/blog/references/internal-linking.md` for
anchor text rules and linking strategy.

#### 5g. Paragraph Rules
- Every paragraph: 40-80 words (never exceed 150)
- Every sentence: max 15-20 words
- Start each paragraph with the most important information
- Target Flesch Reading Ease: 60-70

#### 5h. Heading Rules
- One H1 (title only)
- H2s for main sections (60-70% as questions)
- H3s for subsections only - never skip levels
- Include primary keyword naturally in 2-3 headings

#### 5i. Image Embedding

Standard markdown:
```markdown
![Descriptive alt text - topic keywords naturally](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/...)
```

MDX with Next.js Image (if detected):
```mdx
![Descriptive alt text - topic keywords naturally](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/...)
```

- Place images after H2 headings, before body text
- Space evenly throughout the post (not clustered)
- Alt text should be a full descriptive sentence

#### 5j. Chart Embedding

Standard markdown/HTML:
```html
<figure>
  <svg viewBox="0 0 560 380" ...>...</svg>
  <figcaption>Source: [Source Name], [Year]</figcaption>
</figure>
```

MDX format:
```mdx
<figure className="chart-container" style={{margin: '2.5rem 0', textAlign: 'center', padding: '1.5rem', borderRadius: '12px'}}>
  <svg viewBox="0 0 560 380" ...>...</svg>
</figure>
```

#### 5k. Video Embedding
Embed YouTube videos using srcdoc lazy-loading pattern from `skills/blog/references/video-embeds.md`.
Include aria-label, noscript fallback for AI crawlers. Place after relevant H2, 500+ words apart.

#### 5l. Citation Format
Inline attribution (always):
```markdown
Organic CTR declined 61% with AI Overviews ([Seer Interactive](https://www.seerinteractive.com/), 2025).
```

#### 5m. FAQ Section
Add 3-5 FAQ items with 40-60 word answers. Each answer must contain a statistic.

For MDX with FAQSchema component:
```mdx
<FAQSchema faqs={[
  { question: "Question?", answer: "40-60 word answer with statistic and source." },
]} />
```

For standard markdown:
```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### Question text here?

Answer with statistic and source attribution (40-60 words).
```

#### 5n. Internal Linking
- 5-10 internal links per 2,000-word post
- Link to relevant existing content naturally
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")

### Phase 6: Quality Check

Before delivering, verify:

#### Structure and Content
1. Every H2 opens with a statistic + source
2. No paragraph exceeds 150 words
3. All statistics have named tier 1-3 sources
4. 2-4 charts with type diversity
5. 3-5 inline images with descriptive alt text
6. Cover image present in frontmatter (coverImage + ogImage)
7. FAQ section present with 3-5 items
8. Heading hierarchy is clean (H1 -> H2 -> H3)
9. Meta description is 150-160 chars with a stat

#### New Element Verification
10. TL;DR box present after introduction (40-60 words, contains statistic + source)
11. At least 2-3 information gain markers (`[ORIGINAL DATA]`, `[PERSONAL EXPERIENCE]`, or `[UNIQUE INSIGHT]`)
12. Citation capsules present in major H2 sections (40-60 words, self-contained, quotable)
13. Internal linking zones marked in introduction, H2 sections, FAQ, and conclusion
14. No AI-detectable phrases from banned list (see `agents/blog-writer.md`)

#### Burstiness and Naturalness Check
15. **Sentence length variance** - Verify a mix of short (8-word) and long (25-word) sentences. Uniform sentence length signals AI authorship.
16. **Banned AI phrase scan** - Check for and remove:
    - "in today's digital landscape", "it's important to note", "dive into"
    - "game-changer", "navigate the landscape", "revolutionize", "seamlessly"
    - "cutting-edge", "harness the power of", "leverage" (as verb)
    - "delve", "crucial", "elevate", "foster", "landscape" (overused)
    - "multifaceted", "robust", "tapestry", "embark"
    - Full list in `agents/blog-writer.md`
17. **Contractions** - Verify natural use of contractions ("it's", "we've", "don't", "isn't"). Formal AI prose avoids contractions; natural writing uses them.
18. **Rhetorical questions** - Verify at least one rhetorical question every 200-300 words to break up declarative patterns.
19. **YouTube videos** - 2-3 embeds with lazy loading, aria-labels, and noscript fallback (see `skills/blog/references/video-embeds.md`)

#### Num Nums Bakery HTML Project — Non-negotiable Pre-publish Checklist

These rules are derived from real audit failures on this project. Every point must pass before delivery. Do NOT ask the user to fix these — resolve them before showing the draft.

**Meta & SEO**
- [ ] Meta description must contain at least **2 concrete numbers** (distances, times, counts, percentages). "Order in 48 hrs" alone is not enough. Pattern: `"100% eggless [product] near [suburb] — [N] flavours, [distance] from [location]. Order with [timeframe] notice."`
- [ ] Title tag: must include primary keyword + location. Max 60 chars.

**LCP / Image Performance**
- [ ] The **first image in the article body** (likely the LCP element) must have `fetchpriority="high"` and must NOT have `loading="lazy"`. All subsequent images use `loading="lazy"`.
- [ ] All images must be `.webp` format with descriptive alt text (full sentence, includes product + location).
- [ ] **Unsplash CDN URLs must use `?fm=webp`**, not `?fm=jpg`. The researcher returns `fm=jpg` by default — always replace before embedding. Pattern: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-<id>?fm=webp&q=80&w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop`

**Meta & description length**
- [ ] Meta description must be ≤ 160 characters. Count it. Truncation at 160 chars in SERPs means the phone number or key CTA gets cut — trim from the middle, keep the numbers and CTA at the end.

**External Links — mandatory**
- [ ] Every post must include **at least 2 outbound links** to authoritative tier 1-3 external sources. Acceptable sources for this project:
  - ABS (abs.gov.au) — population, suburb growth, demographic data
  - NSW Education (education.nsw.gov.au) — school term/holiday dates
  - Food Standards Australia (foodstandards.gov.au) — dietary/allergen info
  - NSW Health (health.nsw.gov.au) — food safety context
  - Google Maps (maps.google.com) — travel time reference
  - These links should be placed naturally in the body — never in a "Sources" section bolted on at the end.

**Answer-First H2 openers — every section, no exceptions**
- [ ] Every H2 must open with a paragraph that directly answers the heading's question AND includes either an external stat OR a specific first-party claim with clear provenance. "The most common question we get…" is NOT an answer-first opener. Correct pattern: `[Direct answer statement with a specific number or fact] ([Source]). [1-2 sentences expanding the answer.]`
- [ ] If no external stat exists for a section, use a qualified first-party statement: "From our [N] years of orders / From our internal data / From orders across [area]…" — this makes provenance explicit without fabricating a source.
- [ ] **Sections that rely on personal/internal experience must still open with a sourced stat.** The internal data paragraph comes second, after the stat. Never let a [PERSONAL EXPERIENCE] or [ORIGINAL DATA] marker become the first sentence of an H2 section.

**Chart / SVG data integrity**
- [ ] Charts using exact percentages (e.g. 72%, 65%) must clarify in the figcaption that the data is internal/first-party. Never present internal percentages in a way that implies third-party research.
- [ ] Figcaption format: `"Approximate [metric] — [Business Name] internal [order/sales/customer] data, [year range]. [Any methodological note if needed.]"`
- [ ] Never include "Multiple themes could be selected" or other survey-methodology language unless you actually ran a survey.

**Internal linking — body text**
- [ ] Every reference to another page on the site (e.g. "our cakes", "the order page", "locations") must be a working `<a href>` hyperlink — never plain text.
- [ ] Minimum internal links per post: 5 (sidebar and related posts do not count toward this minimum — body text links only).

**Sidebar related-post links**
- [ ] Every URL in the sidebar "Related Posts" block must point to a **file that already exists** in `blog/`. Check with `ls blog/` before writing. A 404 in the sidebar harms crawlability and user trust. If the target post doesn't exist yet, replace with the nearest existing post on the same topic.

**H2 heading style**
- [ ] At least 60% of H2s must be question-format (end with `?`). Check before delivery.
- [ ] No H2 heading should end mid-thought without punctuation. A heading like "What Size Cake Do You Need" (missing `?`) is a failure.

**Lenis smooth scroll**
- [ ] Every blog post HTML file must include the Lenis smooth scroll block immediately before `</body>`. Never omit it. The exact snippet is defined in the project memory file `feedback_lenis_smooth_scroll.md`.

**Word count & depth**
- [ ] Every post must contain **at least 2,000 words of body prose** (the article-body text, excluding SVG chart labels, nav, sidebar and footer). Count it before delivery — do not estimate. Posts that land at ~1,600–1,900 read as thin; expand with an extra question-format H2 section or deeper detail in existing sections until prose clears 2,000.
- [ ] Aim for **3–5 inline images** in the body (first one is the LCP image with `fetchpriority="high"`, the rest `loading="lazy"`) and **2–4 SVG charts** with even distribution.

**Location accuracy — Harris Park vs Riverstone (two shops)**
- [ ] Num Num's has TWO locations. **Harris Park:** 96/96 Wigram Street, Harris Park NSW 2150 — open daily 11 am–10 pm. **Riverstone:** Shop 8, Riverstone Shopping Centre, Riverstone NSW 2765 — Mon–Fri 6 am–8 pm, Sat–Sun 7 am–7 pm. For a suburb post, choose the genuinely nearest shop as the primary "nearest location": **Harris Park** for Parramatta and central/western suburbs (Harris Park, Westmead, Granville, Merrylands, North Parramatta, Auburn, Rosehill, Rydalmere); **Riverstone** for the north-west (Quakers Hill, Schofields, The Ponds, Box Hill, Marsden Park, Rouse Hill, Tallawong).
- [ ] The LocalBusiness schema (address, geo, opening hours), the sidebar "Nearest Location" card, the footer address block, and every stated drive time/distance MUST all match the chosen nearest shop. Never claim a short drive time (e.g. "5 min" / "15 min") while pointing the schema or address block at the farther shop. Harris Park ≈ 5 min from Parramatta CBD; Riverstone ≈ 25–30 min from Parramatta.

### Phase 6.5: Delivery Contract Enforcement (v1.9.0)

Before Phase 7, run the 5-gate delivery contract per `skills/blog/references/blog-delivery-contract.md`. The user is never the first reviewer; the gates are.

Steps:

1. **Capability discovery + hero**: run `python scripts/blog_preflight.py --draft <folder> --gate 1` to enumerate available paths. If `nanobanana-mcp` is loaded, generate the hero via the MCP tool. Otherwise run `python scripts/generate_hero.py --topic "<title>" --tags "<tags>" --out <folder>` (uses the Gemini, Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay, Openverse ladder).

2. **Format completeness**: render the canonical `.md` to `.html` and `.pdf` via `python scripts/blog_render.py --md <slug>.md --out-dir <folder>`. All three artifacts plus `hero.<ext>` must end up in the draft folder.

3. **Content review (blocking)**: dispatch the `blog-reviewer` agent (Task tool) against the rendered `.html`. The agent emits its scorecard to `<folder>/review.md` ending with `BLOCKING: true|false (reason)`. Threshold: overall score 90/100 or higher AND zero P0 issues per `editorial-heuristics.md`.

4. **Visual + asset gates**: run `python scripts/blog_preflight.py --draft <folder> --strict`. This runs Gate 3 (visual verification via patchright at 3 viewport widths), Gate 4 (reads review.md BLOCKING line), and Gate 5 (asset + link integrity). Exit 0 = ship; exit 1 = block.

5. **Iteration**: on any block, capture the failure diagnostic from `<folder>/preflight-report.json`, re-dispatch the blog-writer agent with the diagnostic as input, and re-run from step 1. Maximum 3 iterations. On the 3rd failure, STOP and present the failure diagnostic instead of the draft.

The orchestrator holds the loop counter; this sub-skill never loops itself.

### Phase 6.8: Mandatory Post-Write Analysis (Num Nums Bakery project)

After writing the HTML file and before delivery, **always run `/blog-analyze`** on the finished post. This is not optional.

Steps:
1. Run the analysis against the newly written file.
2. Fix **every issue** returned, working Critical → High → Medium → Low. Do not present the draft until all findings are resolved.
3. **Always update both checklist files after every post** — this step is unconditional, not "if findings exist." After fixing all issues, go through every finding at every severity level (Critical → Low) and for each one:
   a. Check whether the pattern is already covered verbatim in the **Num Nums Bakery HTML Project — Non-negotiable Pre-publish Checklist** section of this file (SKILL.md).
   b. Check whether it is already covered in the **Quality Gate** section of `HOW-TO-ADD-BLOG-POSTS.md` in the project root.
   c. If either file is missing the pattern, add it to **both files** immediately — same wording, same section, kept in sync.
4. Even if no new patterns were found this run, confirm in your delivery summary: "Checklist files reviewed — no new patterns to add." Never silently skip this step.
5. The rule is permanent: **every finding that surfaces once becomes a pre-check forever.** The checklists grow; they never shrink.

### Phase 7: Delivery

Present the completed article ONLY after Phase 6.5 returns all gates passing AND Phase 6.8 analysis is clean. Include the screenshots from `<folder>/preview/*.png` in the summary so the user can see what they are getting before reading the prose.
